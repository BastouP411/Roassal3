# The RoassalPro Program

The field of visualization is large, and competition is pretty though. Despite the multiple visualization tools around, Roassal succeeded in attracting a solid user base. This page is about structuring the effort around the development of Roassal.

Roassal was born in 2007. Since its inception, Roassal has been deeply redesigned multiple times. Roassal3, the current version of the Roassal series, culminates from all the previous experiences. 

Roassal is used by many open-source and proprietary software systems. We, the development team behind Roassal, are truly happy about it. We believe Roassal makes Pharo a better Pharo, and the current and future generations of Pharo developers deserve a competitive visualization support. The widespread adoption of Roassal within the Pharo and Smalltalk communities comes with responsibilities. We, the leading development team, are taking these community-emerged responsibilities very seriously: _the Pharo community is putting some trust on us, and we must be up to it_.

Roassal is currently supported by a team of full-time and part-time software engineers dedicated to the development of Roassal. As you can guess, making sure monetary resources can flow is central to cope with increasingly demanding users. 

RoassalPro is an organizational program to help you to get the most of Roassal. RoassalPro is about ensuring particular needs are properly addressed, in a profesional fashion. RoassalPro offers a number of services:

  - *Custom design and development*: building and evaluating visualization is a difficult activity that involves not only technical skills, but also ability to design and run experiment protocols. We do have a solid experience in building and assessing visualization for complex domain. We do develop Roassal-related applications.
  - *Roassal extension*: Roassal comes with many features. However, development teams often come with particular requirements. As such, financial support helps boosting the development of Roassal.
  - *Migrating Roassal*: Roassal is written and developed in Pharo. Roassal can be easy to migrate to another Smalltalk-flavored programming languages. We do have experience in maintaining complex cross-dialect applications.
